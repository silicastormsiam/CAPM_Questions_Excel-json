You will receive a raw project management multiple-choice question block. It includes the question text, four answer options listed one after another without labels, and an explanation that contains the correct answer context.

Your task:

1. Add explicit option labels as "Option A:", "Option B:", "Option C:", and "Option D:" before each answer choice, preserving the original option order.

2. Determine the correct answer by analyzing the explanation and match it to the corresponding option.

3. Insert an "Answer:" line specifying the correct option letter (A, B, C, or D).

4. Return the fully formatted question block in this exact structure:

Question: [Question text]  
Option A: [First answer option]  
Option B: [Second answer option]  
Option C: [Third answer option]  
Option D: [Fourth answer option]  
Answer: [Correct option letter]  
Explanation: [Explanation text]

Strictly do not change the wording of any question, options, or explanation beyond adding labels and the answer line. If the correct answer cannot be confidently identified, respond with "Answer: Unknown".

Only provide the formatted question block in your response â€” no extra commentary or explanation.
